    -  Information Leakage via Cryptographic Error Messages
    -  Data Masking Failures (e.g., credit card numbers not properly masked in logs or UI)
  
### XI. Error Handling & Logging
- **A. All**
    -  Verbose Error Messages (stack traces, internal paths, SQL errors, software versions)
        -  Test different inputs, invalid parameters, unexpected data types
    -  Generic vs. Specific Error Messages (avoid revealing too much, but provide enough for user understanding)
    -  Inconsistent Error Handling Across Application
    -  Improper Logging (sensitive data in logs - passwords, API keys, session tokens, PII)
    -  Insufficient Logging (not logging security-relevant events - logins, failed logins, access control failures, input validation failures)
    -  Logs Accessible by Unauthorized Users
    -  Log Injection / Log Forging (injecting fake log entries or CRLF to break log format)
    -  Error Codes that Reveal Too Much Information
  
### XII. Client-Side Security (Beyond DOM XSS)
- **A. All**
    -  Insecure Use of `postMessage()` API (missing origin validation, data validation)
    -  Insecure Data Storage in Browser (Local Storage, Session Storage, Cookies - check for sensitive info)
    -  Client-Side URL Redirects (Open Redirect if user input controls destination without validation)
    -  Clickjacking / UI Redressing (ensure `X-Frame-Options` or `CSP frame-ancestors` are used)
    -  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfigurations allowing unauthorized origins
    -  Subresource Integrity (SRI) Not Used for External JS/CSS
    -  Outdated or Vulnerable JavaScript Libraries (Retire.js)
    -  Improperly Sanitized Data Displayed from Client-Side Storage
    -  WebAssembly (WASM) vulnerabilities (if used, memory corruption, logic flaws)
    -  Service Worker vulnerabilities (interception, cache poisoning)
  
### XIII. Reporting & Post-Assessment
- **A. All**
    -  Document All Findings (description, vulnerable URLs/parameters, PoC steps, screenshots/videos)
    -  Assess Impact and Likelihood (CVSS scoring or similar)
    -  Provide Clear Remediation Guidance (specific to the vulnerability and technology)
    -  Executive Summary for Management
    -  Technical Details for Development Teams
    -  Positive Findings (what the application does well)
    -  Strategic Recommendations for Overall Security Posture Improvement
    -  (Optional) Retest after fixes are applied.
